title: On IE and buttons
---

<p>

    With regards to <a href="http://allinthehead.com/" rel="acquaintance met colleague">Drew</a>’s recent post <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/330/coping-with-internet-explorers-mishandling-of-buttons">Internet Explorer’s mishandlings of <code>BUTTON</code>s</a>, I thought I would post a solution I came up with whilst serving at <a href="http:/uk.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> for the new <a href="http://yanswersblog.com/index.php/archives/2008/07/31/make-your-answers-shine/">Ask/Answer flow</a>.

</p>



<h2>What’s the problem?</h2>



<p>

    For those of you who’ve not read Drew’s above–linked post (you should, it explains the problem concisely), the issue can be broken down thusly:

</p>



<ul><li><code>BUTTON</code> elements are good to use for “Web 2.0” styling like rounded corners, because they allow elements to be nested inside them (in our case, empty <code>SPAN</code>s or similar);</li>

    <li>Internet Explorer mis-handles the <code>BUTTON</code>s by sending the entire contents (equivalent to <code>innerHTML</code>) along to the server, rather than the defined <code>value</code>;</li>

    <li>This means you need to fork your server side code to deal with the possibility of the content not being what you expect.</li>

</ul><h2>What’s the problem with Drew’s method?</h2>



<p>

    Nothing major, except that it all depends on the way he “<q>(throws) the <code>SPAN</code> off-screen with CSS</q>”. If he’s just using off–left, <a href="http://www.accessibilitytips.com/2008/03/04/positioning-content-offscreen/">screen readers will still be able to see the content</a>, which in his example is “<q>ABC123</q>”: whilst this is only present for the example given, could theoretically be anything. Either way it’s unlikely to be relevant to a screen–reader (or a search crawler, when it comes down to it).</p>



<p>As I stated, it’s very minor nit–picking. But what is the Internet for if not to nit–pick (or to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">call people Nazis</a>)?</p>



<h2>So what’s my solution?</h2>



<p>Despite Drew being entirely correct when he said that <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/330/coping-with-internet-explorers-mishandling-of-buttons#c004656"><q>a solution that relies on JavaScript isn’t a solution</q></a>, I’m going to do one anyway. Key features include:</p>



<ul><li>Graceful degradation: in all browsers without Javascript enabled regular <code>input type="submit"</code> elements are used;</li>

    <li>Allows for extra styling: spurious (and quite horrible) extra <code>span</code> elements are inserted, allowing for bonus styling hooks; and</li>

    <li>Accessibility is enhanced: since Internet Explorer famously has <a href="http://failblog.com">fail</a> with regards to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#pseudo-class-selectors">CSS pseudo-class</a> selectors, and given these are essential for keyboard users (to simulate mouseover etc.), we add in some event handling to enhance the buttons for IE mouse/keyboard users.</li>

</ul><p>

    Note that no <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is provided: this is left as an exercise for the reader. Also note that it’s written for a site using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/"><abbr title="Yahoo! User Interface library">YUI</abbr> library</a>, which is the front–end framework of choice where this code was originally written.

</p>



<p>

    Also bear in mind this this comes with a <a href="#the-big-caveat">really really big caveat</a>.

</p>



<pre class="html">

&lt;form action="" method="post"&gt;

    &lt;-- other FORM fields before (remembering our LABELs and FIELDSETs!!)--&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

        &lt;input type="submit" class="cta" name="my-submit" value="Save Application"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;



&lt;!-- we need the YUI basics --&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"

 src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.2/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

 

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

YAHOO.namespace('EU.UI');

// CTA stands for "call to action", a standard Yahoo! term for a rounded corner button

YAHOO.EU.UI.cta = function() {

    function fixSubmit(e) {

        // this function is only fired for browsers which don't understand 

        // button type="submit", so we're okay to proceed without browser 

        // checking

        

        // clobber default behaviour

        YAHOO.util.Event.preventDefault(e);

        

        var form = this.form;

        // IE will submit all buttons at once, so kill/disable the ones we didn't click

        var els = form.getElementsByTagName('button');

        if (els.length &gt; 0) {

            for (var i=0, l=els.length; i&lt;l; i++) {

                // check if it's the same element--name isn't reliable as 

                // there could be multiple forms with the same named element

                if (els[i] !== this) {

                    // note this will cause a "flash" of greyed out buttons

                    els[i].disabled = true;

                }

            }

        }

        

        // now that all buttons except the one that was clicked are disabled, 

        // send the form along with just the button clicked

        form.submit();

    }

    return {

        init : function() {

            var els = YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('cta', 'input');

            // these could be anything--just use them as styling hooks

            var startContent = '&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;';

            var endContent = '&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;';

            if (els.length &gt; 0) {

                for (var i=0, l=els.length; i&lt;l; i++) {

                    var el = els[i];

                    if (el.type.toLowerCase() === 'submit') {

<h2 id="the-big-caveat">“You use(d) Javascript for presentation you bad bad man”</h2>



<p>Yes I do. Well, I did (I only did this type of thing once). Glad you’ve been paying attention. I believe I’m okay doing this for a few reasons (so listen closely):</p>



<ul><li>The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains un–polluted. I believe this to be of prime important, as HTML is the only part of the web standards “trinity” (HTML, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and Javascript) that is always delivered to all user agents;</li>

    <li>The Javascript used does not detract from the accessibility in any way; and</li>

    <li>Sometimes the presentation is important enough for your audience or goal that you need to do things like this. Call it an over–optimisation in the name of: accessibility over separation–of–concerns purity, and brand/design requirements.</li>

</ul><p>

    You may, as is your wont, disagree. That’s okay, but before I get flamed (which I can’t, given that I still don’t have comments enabled), I want it to be known that this script was produced under the above caveats. As usual, <abbr title="Your Mileage May Vary">YMMV</abbr>. Just don’t go doing this type of thing often.
