title: A week using Emacs
---

<p>

    From a consensus vote of two (<a href="http://binaryclub.com/" rel="friend met co-worker">Hunter</a> and <a href="http://jasontrost.com" rel="co-worker friend met">Jason</a>) out of three, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is the preferred editor of <a href="http://smarkets.com">Smarkets</a>.

</p>

<p>

    Historically, my editor experience runs roughly thus:

</p>

<ol><li>Notepad (early days of learning HTML from liberally using “View source”);</li>

    <li>Dreamweaver (college);</li>

    <li>Homesite (post-college until 2007); and</li>

    <li><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> (2007 onwards, when thankfully I’ve had a Mac).</li>

</ol><p>

    with a little <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vi(M)</a> interspersed here and there as my server—side editor.

</p>

<p>

    In an effort to fit in a bit better with the team (and because they continually bang on about it like it’s the greatest thing since the Internet), I’ve committed to trying Emacs for a week of full time development. I’ll write up a review of my thoughts at week end.

</p>

<h2>Misgivings</h2>

<p>

    In the interests of disclosure, I have some misgivings about Emacs:

</p>

<ul><li>The lack of respect it will have for OS X–wide keyboard shortcuts. Having to re-learn keyboard commands just to cut and paste (for example), will drive me up the wall;</li>

    <li>Using Elisp to configure it;</li>

    <li>The auto—indent mode of Emacs doesn’t work very well with my HTML coding style. Emacs thinks it knows when/where you’d like to indent code, and pressing “tab” will guess for you. I prefer HTML to just indent 4 spaces when I tab.</li>

</ul><p>

    See you back here in a week for the review (and hopefully solutions to common web developer problems that Emacs causes).
