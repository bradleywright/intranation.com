title: Web–based services I pay for
---

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://joshr.posterous.com/web-based-services-i-pay-for">Josh’s post</a>, I’ve decided to list (and give a shout out to) the services on the web that I pay for.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://me.com">MobileMe</a> (£59/year) for computer, address book, and calendar synchronisation. I pay for MobileMe because I have 2 Macs (work, home) and an iPhone, and it’s by far the easiest way to keep them all synchronised. It’s a shame it costs so much, as I don’t use the email or website publishing aspects of it at all.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.tuffmail.com/">Tuffmail</a> (about £5/month) for <acronym title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</acronym> email. I was put onto Tuffmail by <a href="http://allinthehead.com/" rel="colleague met">Drew</a>. It’s a great service with fantastic spam protection, and since it’s a well–behaved IMAP service it functions much better with desktop <abbr title="applications">apps</abbr> than <a href="http://mail.google.com">Gmail</a>. I’m currently on the fence as to whether I’m going to go back to <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps for your domain</a> for email and calendar. For the moment Tuffmail is great, though.</li>

<li><a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">PRGMR</a> ($48/year) for <abbr title="Virtual private server">VPS</abbr> hosting. I moved away from <a href="http://slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> a few months back because I wanted to downscale my hosting costs. PRGMR have been great so far, really solid, and the price is certainly right.</li>

<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (about £0.03/month) for S3 and CloudFront. I host static assets and some other backup type things there. It’s clearly the cheapest thing on my expenses list.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> ($25/year) for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/intranation">photo hosting</a>. I’m sure everyone knows what Flickr is by now.</li>

<li><a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> ($36/year). I like Last.fm and what they do, as well as using their service a lot, so I think it’s worth paying for.</li>

</ul><h2>Things I used to pay for</h2>

<ul><li><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>. I stopped this because I now <a href="http://tumblr.intranation.com/post/766290565/how-set-up-your-own-private-git-server-linux">host my own private Git <abbr title="repositories">repos</abbr></a>.</li>

<li><a href="http://slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> for VPS hosting. See above.</li>

</ul><p>Finally, I’d like to mention <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>. As a service I think Dropbox is absolutely best of breed—it’s hands down the smoothest, slickest, and most tightly integrated web/desktop hybrid I’ve ever used. I don’t actually pay for it as I don’t have a requirement for their lowest plan yet, but if I did I’d pay it without thinking. Fantastic service (I have a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE5NjgwOQ">referral link, too</a>), cannot recommend it highly enough. I wish MobileMe was as slick as Dropbox.</p>
