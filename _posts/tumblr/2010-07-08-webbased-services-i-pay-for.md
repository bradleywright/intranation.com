Inspired by [Josh’s post](http://joshr.posterous.com/web-based-services-i-pay-
for), I’ve decided to list (and give a shout out to) the services on the web
that I pay for.

  * [MobileMe](http://me.com) (£59/year) for computer, address book, and calendar synchronisation. I pay for MobileMe because I have 2 Macs (work, home) and an iPhone, and it’s by far the easiest way to keep them all synchronised. It’s a shame it costs so much, as I don’t use the email or website publishing aspects of it at all.
  * [Tuffmail](http://www.tuffmail.com/) (about £5/month) for IMAP email. I was put onto Tuffmail by [Drew](http://allinthehead.com/). It’s a great service with fantastic spam protection, and since it’s a well–behaved IMAP service it functions much better with desktop apps than [Gmail](http://mail.google.com). I’m currently on the fence as to whether I’m going to go back to [Google Apps for your domain](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html) for email and calendar. For the moment Tuffmail is great, though.
  * [PRGMR](http://prgmr.com/xen/) ($48/year) for VPS hosting. I moved away from [Slicehost](http://slicehost.com/) a few months back because I wanted to downscale my hosting costs. PRGMR have been great so far, really solid, and the price is certainly right.
  * [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) (about £0.03/month) for S3 and CloudFront. I host static assets and some other backup type things there. It’s clearly the cheapest thing on my expenses list.
  * [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) ($25/year) for [photo hosting](http://flickr.com/photos/intranation). I’m sure everyone knows what Flickr is by now.
  * [Last.fm](http://last.fm) ($36/year). I like Last.fm and what they do, as well as using their service a lot, so I think it’s worth paying for.

## Things I used to pay for

  * [GitHub](http://github.com/). I stopped this because I now [host my own private Git repos](http://tumblr.intranation.com/post/766290565/how-set-up-your-own-private-git-server-linux).
  * [Slicehost](http://slicehost.com) for VPS hosting. See above.

Finally, I’d like to mention [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/). As a service
I think Dropbox is absolutely best of breed—it’s hands down the smoothest,
slickest, and most tightly integrated web/desktop hybrid I’ve ever used. I
don’t actually pay for it as I don’t have a requirement for their lowest plan
yet, but if I did I’d pay it without thinking. Fantastic service (I have a
[referral link, too](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE5NjgwOQ)), cannot
recommend it highly enough. I wish MobileMe was as slick as Dropbox.
