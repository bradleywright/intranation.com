<blockquote><p>Today, I became a British Citizen. Here is me receiving my certificate of naturalisation from the former speaker of Hackney. She gave a great speech to all the new citizens and guests, plus check out those fresh trainers underneath her gown. This is how we roll in Hackney.</p></blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m very proud of <a href="http://yahnyinlondon.com">Amanda</a> for becoming a British citizen today. The ceremony itself was actually quite nice—very humble and simple, with a minimum of fuss. I learned that out of the two pledges (one non–religious, one for &#8220;Almighty God&#8221;), the non–religious is the default so as not to cause any friction with religious citizens–to–be who might not have read the application correctly.</p>
