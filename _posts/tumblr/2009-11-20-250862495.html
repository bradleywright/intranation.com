title: 1Password 3 has been released

<a href="http://www.switchersblog.com/2009/11/1password-3-is-here.html">1Password 3 has been released</a><br/><p>1Password, one of my favourite pieces of software, has finally made public release after a short beta period. For the security conscious Mac user who also values convenience, this software is as good as it gets. You can even <a href="http://www.switchersblog.com/2008/10/1password-29-br.html">synchronise it between computers with the excellent Dropbox</a>.</p>
