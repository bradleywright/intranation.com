As I indicated [much earlier](/post/786562910/web-based-services-i-pay-for), I
stopped paying for GitHub because I have the server and [know-how to host my
own repos](/post/766290565/how-set-up-your-own-private-git-server-linux).

However, my general policy is that I'm always happy to pay a small fee to
services I don't use in a way I should to justify their value, but merely to
reward them for doing good work.

So that brings me to the point of my post: with
[GitHub](https://github.com/)'s new [image view
modes](https://github.com/blog/817-behold-image-view-modes), they're doing
amazing things for version control and collaboration, and I wanted to support
that. So I'm now a paid up member of GitHub again.

Keep up the good work!
