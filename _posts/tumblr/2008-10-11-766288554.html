title: Installing Django on OSX
---

<p>Despite <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> already having fairly <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#installing-official-release">comprehensive documentation</a>, I still sometimes see people get confused about where the code goes, or how to get up and running quickly. Since a lot of these people are on <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Macs</a>, I thought it pertinent to write all the steps down to get your own Django development environment running on OS X. <strong>Important point:</strong> this will be done entirely with native OS X tools, and won’t require you to install <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> or any other tools.</p>

<p>From this point on we’re going to be working almost exclusively in the terminal, so fire up Terminal.app (or iTerm, if you&#8217;re that way inclined).</p>

<h2>Python and package management</h2>

<p>OS X ships with <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> already (2.5 on Leopard, 2.4 on Tiger), but it’s a slightly modified version of Python. To see which version you have, type the following in a terminal:</p>

<pre><kbd>python</kbd></pre>

<p>And you should see something like:</p>

<pre><samp>$ python

Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Feb  4 2008, 21:48:13) 

[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)] on darwin

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp></pre>

<p>This is actually the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/tut/node4.html">Python interactive shell</a>, and you can run Python commands in here to test them out or check for installed packages. For example, we can see if Django is installed yet:</p>

<pre><kbd>import django</kbd></pre>

<p>Of course, if this worked successfully you wouldn’t need this article, so an error like the following should be seen:</p>

<pre><samp>Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;

ImportError: No module named django</samp></pre>

<p>The way Python works with import is that it looks in all the directories on sys.path to find packages. Packages are diectories with <var>__init__.py</var> files in them (normally), or sometimes just a single Python file. For more on packages, see <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/tut/node8.html">the Python documentation on packages</a>.</p>

<p>To see which directories are looked in for packages by Python, type the following into the Python shell:</p>

<pre><kbd>import sys

sys.path</kbd></pre>

<p>Which should return a list (indexed mutable array) of directory paths. One of them will most likely be <samp>/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages</samp>, which is the standard Python packages directory. It’s here that most Python package managers (like <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">easy_install</a>) will try and put packages, but I’d normally rather keep them in somewhere which doesn’t require <kbd>sudo</kbd> to edit or change them. It’s a development environment after all!</p>

<h2>Add to the Python packages</h2>

<p>So we’re now going to add our own directory into the local version of Python. First we create a directory in our home:</p>

<pre><kbd>mkdir ~/pythonpath</kbd></pre>

<p>Then we need to add this directory to the <var>PYTHONPATH</var> environment variable:</p>

<pre><kbd>echo "export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/pythonpath:\$PYTHONPATH" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile

. ~/.bash_profile</kbd></pre>

<p><var>PYTHONPATH</var> is intended to <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/tut/node8.html#SECTION008120000000000000000">extend the module search path</a>, and in this case we will use it to add user–specific extensions to Python. We added it to your <var>bash_profile</var>, so it should be available whenever you open a terminal window from now on.</p>

<p>Now we can verify that it&#8217;s available:</p>

<pre><kbd>python -c "import sys; print sys.path"</kbd></pre>

<p>And your new <var>pythonpath</var> directory should be listed there.</p>

<h2>Install Django</h2>

<p>Now we need to install Django. I recommend running on the ”1.0.X” version, which is the “1.0 release with just bug fixes added” version, which is currently only available in <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>:</p>

<pre><kbd>svn co <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/releases/1.0.X/django">http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/releases/1.0.X/django</a> ~/pythonpath/django</kbd></pre>

<p>which should check out the contents of 1.0.X into your <var>pythonpath</var>. If you don’t have Subversion installed, you can download the 1.0 tagged release as a tarball:</p>

<pre><kbd>mkdir ~/source

cd ~/source

curl -O <a href="http://media.djangoproject.com/releases/1.0/Django-1.0.tar.gz">http://media.djangoproject.com/releases/1.0/Django-1.0.tar.gz</a>

tar zxfv Django-1.0.tar.gz

mv Django-1.0/django ~/pythonpath/django</kbd></pre>

<p>Which achieves the same thing as the Subversion way, except you won’t be able to update your code as new releases are tagged.</p>

<h3>Check that Django is installed</h3>

<p>Type the following into a command line:</p>

<pre><kbd>python -c "import django"</kbd></pre>

<p>No errors is a Good Thing™.</p>

<p>Now you have Django running, but you&#8217;ll need to get <var>django-admin.py</var> onto your path so that you can <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project">create new projects</a>. You can either do:</p>

<pre><kbd>~/pythonpath/django/bin/django-admin.py [arguments]</kbd></pre>

<p>or get that directory onto your path. I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>Now you have everything you need to run Django, but you also need a database.</p>

<h2>Install MySQL</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> is by far the most straight–forward database to install, since it comes with an <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#macosx-dmg">OS X package</a>, so go over and install that. It should give you a nice System Preferences panel as well.</p>

<p>Now you need to add the MySQL commands to your path:</p>

<pre><kbd>echo "export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile

. ~/.bash_profile</kbd></pre>

<p>And test that it works:</p>

<pre><kbd>mysql -u root</kbd>

<samp>Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with&#160;; or \g.

Your MySQL connection id is 1

Server version: 5.0.51b MySQL Community Server (GPL)



Type &#8216;help;&#8217; or &#8216;\h&#8217; for help. Type &#8216;\c&#8217; to clear the buffer.



mysql&gt;</samp></pre>

<p><kbd>Ctrl + d</kbd> exits from the client.</p>

<h3>Update: Install MySQLdb drivers</h3>

<p>Python doesn’t ship with a native MySQL driver, so you need to install <var>python-mysqldb</var> as well.</p>

<pre><kbd>mkdir -p ~/source

cd ~/source

curl -O \

<a href="http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mysql-python/MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz">http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mysql-python/MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz</a>

tar zxfv MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz

cd MySQL-python-1.2.2</kbd></pre>

<p>Now there’s an issue with MySQLdb for Mac, in that there’s an error in the C code that powers it. Luckily it’s an easy fix. Edit the <var>~/source/MySQL-python-1.2.2/_mysql.c</var> file, and add <kbd>//</kbd> to the start of the line that reads:</p>

<pre><samp>#define uint unsigned int</samp></pre>

<p>So that it instead reads:</p>

<pre><samp>//#define uint unsigned int</samp></pre>

<p>and save the file. This code was on line 38 when I last checked. Now you can build and install the extension:</p>

<pre><kbd>python setup.py build

sudo python setup.py install</kbd></pre>

<p>And it will be installed in your site packages. <strong>Note:</strong> I forgot this step the first time around, so thanks <a href="http://kerincosford.com/" rel="friend met colleague">Kerin</a> for reminding me.</p>

<h2>Finished</h2>

<p>Now you’ve done everything you need to begin the tutorials in the <a href="http://djangobook.com/">Django Book</a> (with the caveat that you’ll also need to read the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.0-porting-guide/">0.96 to 1.0 porting guide</a>), and in the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/">getting started guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Bonus points: Python Imaging Library</h2>

<p>In order to use the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#imagefield">ImageField</a> model field, you need to have the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a> (or PIL) installed, as the images need to be validated and scaled by the model.</p>

<p>OS X doesn’t ship with PIL, so we need to install it ourselves.</p>

<p>You can download a <a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/dmg/PIL-1.1.6-py2.5-macosx10.4-2007-05-18.dmg">pre–compiled version</a> from <a href="http://pythonmac.org">PythonMac</a>. This will be installed in the <var>site-packages</var> directory we saw earlier, and hence requires <var>sudo</var> on your computer (that’s what the little “you need to be authorised” popup dialogue is, more or less).</p>

<p>However, the installer will not run quite as planned, as it <a href="http://www.p16blog.com/p16/2008/05/appengine-installing-pil-on-os-x-1053.html">PIL on OS X installs itself in the wrong place</a>. We need to run a few commands before we can run the freshly downloaded installer:</p>

<pre><kbd>sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/ /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework

echo "export \

PYTHONPATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/\

site-packages/:\$PYTHONPATH" \

&gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile

. ~/.bash_profile</kbd></pre>

<p>Now run the installer and all should be good.</p>

<h2>Bonus bonus points: dmigrations</h2>

<p>If you have Subversion, and have any plans at all to update your site post–launch, you should be using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/">dmigrations</a>. Basically you get it onto your Python path:</p>

<pre><kbd>svn co <a href="http://dmigrations.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dmigrations">http://dmigrations.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dmigrations</a> ~/pythonpath/dmigrations</kbd></pre>

<p>and then <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/wiki/DmigrationsTutorial">follow the dmigrations tutorial</a> to get up and running. Having migrated <a href="http://intranation.com/" rel="me">this very site</a> to dmigrations <em>after</em> launch, I can tell you that it’s much easier to just use it from the very beginning.</p>

<p>Note that you don’t strictly need dmigrations to develop on, but it’s something you definitely want to be thinking about before launching anything publicly using Django.</p>

<h2>Really finished</h2>

<p>So now you should be ready to be up and running with Django on your Mac. Happy coding!</p>
