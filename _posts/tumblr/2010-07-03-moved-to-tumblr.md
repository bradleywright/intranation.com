So I’ve moved my [old blog](http://intranation.com) over to
[Tumblr](http://tumblr.com)’s excellent free service.

## Why?

One of the main reasons is that I hadn’t updated my other site since March,
and before that I’d posted a mere 12 times.

I felt weighed down by the usual length of my posts, and whilst this was
likely an issue and expectation only I had, it was demotivating.

Of course, the length issue could be solved by just posting shorting missives
to my site, but the custom software I’d written wasn’t very supportive of that
kind of post, and given my fairly busy [day job at
Smarkets](http://smarkets.com/) I was unwilling to spend any time adding
features. Tumblr, on the other hand, is perfect for multi–medium and
multi–form posts.

I also had existing experience skinning [Amanda](http://yahnyinlondon.com/)’s
own Tumblr, so I know I can customise it fairly easily.

## The move

So with that out of the way, here we are. I hope to post more, but in lesser
form, in the future.
