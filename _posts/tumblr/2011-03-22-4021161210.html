title: Now paying for GitHub
---

<p>As I indicated <a href="/post/786562910/web-based-services-i-pay-for">much earlier</a>, I stopped paying for GitHub because I have the server and <a href="/post/766290565/how-set-up-your-own-private-git-server-linux">know-how to host my own repos</a>.</p>



<p>However, my general policy is that I&#8217;m always happy to pay a small fee to services I don&#8217;t use in a way I should to justify their value, but merely to reward them for doing good work.</p>



<p>So that brings me to the point of my post: with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>&#8217;s new <a href="https://github.com/blog/817-behold-image-view-modes">image view modes</a>, they&#8217;re doing amazing things for version control and collaboration, and I wanted to support that. So I&#8217;m now a paid up member of GitHub again.</p>



<p>Keep up the good work!</p>
