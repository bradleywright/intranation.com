title: Unacceptable Marketing Practices from Carsonified
---

<p>Carsonified, the property of one Ryan Carson (and family), and seller of tickets to <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/" rel="nofollow">expensive advertising fairs</a>, seem to think it’s okay to send me unsolicited bulk email because I’m <a href="http://djangopeople.net/intranation/">listed on</a> <a href="http://djangopeople.net/">Django People</a>.</p>



<p>It’s unfortunate that I had to vent like this, as I was planning on releasing a small literature–related project I’ve been working on in my spare time. That shall have to wait until later in the week, as those who know me know that my spleen is of utmost importance to me.</p>



<h2>The definition of spam</h2>



<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%%28electronic%%29"><p>(S)pam…is the practice of sending unwanted e-mail messages, frequently with commercial content</p></blockquote>



<p>This is near enough to what they sent me to easily be classified as spam. The fact that they prefaced the email with a pre–emptive apology only makes the situation worse, as clearly it was already known that the tactic was a poor and mercenary one.</p>



<p>Enough negatives have been said of spam in the past that I need not continue this mini–rant, but I’ll leave you with some text of the email (redactions to avoid potential commercial gain non–withstanding), and hope that you agree with me:</p>



<blockquote><p>Hey Django People.</p>

<p>I really hope that you are not offended by my emailing you. I acquired your details from Django people because I feel this workshop may of interest to you. The one day course is being lead by Jeff Croft who was one of the original team at World Online with the inception of the framework and still a leading contributor today. We are offering a discount to members of Django People. Using the following code when booking will reduce the price by 15%%&#8230;</p>

<p>[REDACTED]</p>

<p>&#8230;[rest of email content concerning beginner courses]&#8230;</p>

<p>I may email you sometime next year with details of another Django event. If you would rather not receive any further mail please reply with STOP in the subject bar and any words of chastisement you feel like divulging.</p>
