title: Moved to Tumblr
---

<p>So I’ve moved my <a href="http://intranation.com">old <abbr title="weblog">blog</abbr></a> over to <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>’s excellent free service.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>One of the main reasons is that I hadn’t updated my other site since March, and before that I’d posted a mere 12 times.</p>

<p>I felt weighed down by the usual length of my posts, and whilst this was likely an issue and expectation only I had, it was demotivating.</p>

<p>Of course, the length issue could be solved by just posting shorting missives to my site, but the custom software I’d written wasn’t very supportive of that kind of post, and given my fairly busy <a href="http://smarkets.com/">day job at Smarkets</a> I was unwilling to spend any time adding features. Tumblr, on the other hand, is perfect for multi–medium and multi–form posts.</p>

<p>I also had existing experience skinning <a href="http://yahnyinlondon.com/" rel="friend met sweetheart">Amanda</a>’s own Tumblr, so I know I can customise it fairly easily.</p>

<h2>The move</h2>

<p>So with that out of the way, here we are. I hope to post more, but in lesser form, in the future.</p>
