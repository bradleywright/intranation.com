title: Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex and VMWare Fusion Tools
---

<p>According to the <a href="http://vmware.com/support/fusion2/doc/releasenotes_fusion_202.html">release notes for Fusion 2.0.2</a>, VMWare Fusion:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://vmware.com/support/fusion2/doc/releasenotes_fusion_202.html"><p>Supports Ubuntu 8.10 as a guest operating system, including features such as VMware Tools with prebuilt kernel modules, Easy Install, and Unity.</p></blockquote>

<p>…and I did find this to be the case, until the first system upgrade hit and I had to reboot. Then I found that I could no longer resize the window and have the desktop adjust resolutions appropriately, and copy/paste no longer worked between desktops. In short, VMWare Tools was broken.</p>

<h2>How to fix it</h2>

<p>If you’re unlucky enough to have this happen to you, I suggest the following:</p>

<ul><li>Optional first step: in your Ubuntu VM, type: <kbd>sudo apt-get install ssh</kbd> to install SSH. This at least allows you to access the box from your Mac with copy/paste etc. (To find out the IP address, type <kbd>ifconfig</kbd>, and note the <samp>eth0 &#8230; inet addr:</samp> value.);</li>

<li>Invoke the following command as root (either with <samp>sudo</samp> or as root itself): <kbd>/usr/bin/vmware-config-tools.pl</kbd>;</li>

<li>Answer the default answer to each of the questions asked (most of them are <samp>yes</samp>, except for the experimental question).</li>

<li>Restart your box.</li>

</ul><p>You should now have a working VMWare Tools installation that survives over reboots. Makes playing with Linux desktops much more palatable.</p>

<h2>Final notes</h2>

<p>VMWare Tools seems like it fails to start after updating the system due to the following error:</p>

<pre><samp>/usr/lib/vmware-tools/sbin32/vmware-guestd: error while loading shared libraries: libdnet.so.1: 

cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</samp></pre>

<p>I don’t know enough about Linux to have a guess what that means, but I suppose that when VMWare Tools is re–compiled in the steps mentioned above that it reconciles this issue.</p>

<h2>…and why was I trying out Ubuntu?</h2>

<p>I’m currently learning <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, and since the Mac version is a bit crippled and slow it seemed best to use a Linux <abbr title="distribution">distro</abbr> to do so.</p>
