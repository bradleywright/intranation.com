<p>For the last two–and–a–half weeks, <a href="http://yahnyinlondon.com" rel="friend met sweetheart">Amanda</a> and I have been on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Mongolian_Railway">Trans–Mongolian railway</a> from Moscow to Beijing.</p>

<p>Overall, the trip was about 9000km, and included some stretches of up to 36 hours on the train on any one leg.</p>

<p>I’m still sorting out the photos from the trip, but once they’re uploaded I promise a longer post with photos included.</p>
