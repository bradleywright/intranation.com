title: Follow up to previous UX and Ryan Carson post
---

<p>My <a href="http://tumblr.intranation.com/post/1064741801/ux-professional-is-a-real-role-and-an-important-one">previous post</a> seems to have <a href="http://twitter.com/ryancarson/status/22994531296">gotten the attention of Ryan himself</a>. As Ryan mentions, I&#8217;m on Tumblr, which means no comments.</p>



<p>I invite Ryan to email me at <code>brad at this domain</code> with his comments (I also did on Twitter, but last time I checked he had blocked me) and I will publish them.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also like to note that at the time of writing he has additionally blocked <a href="http://twitter.com/hellomuller/status/22993356028">Tom Muller</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/kapowaz/status/22974121850">Ben Darlow</a> on Think Vitamin, so I wonder if he&#8217;s genuinely interested in dialogue at all.</p>



<p>See below for what I currently see when visiting Ryan&#8217;s most recent Tweet (or should I say &#8220;dialogue&#8221;?):</p>
