<blockquote>Our minds moved fast and at that point in sync. When others were present, we felt the pace and power diminish, until, a bit like lovers desperate to get to love-making but disturbed by old friends dropping round, we would try to bustle them out, steering them doorwards with a hearty slap on the back.</blockquote>&#8212;Tony Blair talking about Gordon Brown in his new autobiography. Found in the Guardianâ€™s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2010/sep/01/tonyblair-past">live blog of their reading</a>. One of the more unintentionally comedic quotes in what appears (by all accounts) to be a seven hundred-odd pages of delusion and an utter lack of humility or shame.
