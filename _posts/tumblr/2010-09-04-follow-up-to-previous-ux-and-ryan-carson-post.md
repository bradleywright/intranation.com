My [previous post](http://tumblr.intranation.com/post/1064741801/ux-
professional-is-a-real-role-and-an-important-one) seems to have [gotten the
attention of Ryan himself](http://twitter.com/ryancarson/status/22994531296).
As Ryan mentions, I'm on Tumblr, which means no comments.

I invite Ryan to email me at `brad at this domain` with his comments (I also
did on Twitter, but last time I checked he had blocked me) and I will publish
them.

I'd also like to note that at the time of writing he has additionally blocked
[Tom Muller](http://twitter.com/hellomuller/status/22993356028) and [Ben
Darlow](http://twitter.com/kapowaz/status/22974121850) on Think Vitamin, so I
wonder if he's genuinely interested in dialogue at all.

See below for what I currently see when visiting Ryan's most recent Tweet (or
should I say "dialogue"?):
