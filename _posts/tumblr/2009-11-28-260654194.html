title: (One of) my problem(s) with MobileMe
---

<p>I currently use <a href="http://apple.com/">Apple</a>’s <a href="http://me.com/">MobileMe</a> service to keep my iPhone and Mac in <abbr title="synchronisation">sync. This I do slightly begrudgingly, but do so for the following reasons:</abbr></p>

<ol><li>The effort of setting up my own WebDAV server in order to keep my precious <a href="http://omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> running across my phone and desktop is too much at the moment;</li>

<li>I like having push calendar updates; and</li>

<li>I like having push address book updates.</li>

</ol><p>My chief problem with MobileMe is that it just seems to be implemented badly, which, as a professional developer, grates on me. It’s very slow over WebDAV (taking around 10s to sync a small SQLite database), and the way files are shared over iDisk is just stupid: it creates a pre–sized disk image (in my case 2GB) on your hard drive and then syncs that. What if I had chosen to use the maximum 20GB size? I&#8217;d have a 20GB lump (mostly empty) sitting on my hard drive, because the size is pre–allocated.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> is a shining example of how to do file–sharing between computers properly: it creates a folder in your home directory that just takes up the room required by the files you’ve uploaded. Easy, works seamlessly, and has a sweet iPhone application.</p>

<p>Increasingly, MobileMe is seeming like more of a hassle than is worth the money: and it’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/pricing/">quite a bit of money</a>.</p>
