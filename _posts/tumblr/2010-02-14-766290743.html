title: Using Dropbox as a Git repository
---

<p>So last month <a href="http://intranation.com/entries/2010/01/how-set-up-your-own-private-git-server-linux/">I wrote a bit about setting up your own personal Git repositories on a Linux box</a>, and how to use that for sharing code.</p>

<p>I’ve had a slight epiphany since then: what if I just used the awesome <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE5NjgwOQ">my referral link</a>, if you’re likely to sign up) to share Git repositories between computers? Dropbox seems able to get through most corporate firewalls (my <a href="http://thisisglobal.com" rel="nofollow">previous employer</a> blocked SSH, for example), and is very unobtrusive in its synchronisation behaviour.</p>

<h2>Enough introductions, make with the commands</h2>

<p>Okay, here we go. Basically, we’re just going add a new <code>remote</code> which points at Dropbox (in the same way the <code>origin</code> remote typically points at your primary external repository). Please note these instructions should be mostly <var>*Nix</var> agnostic—but they’re only tested on <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a>.</p>

<p>First, create the Git repository in Dropbox (assuming your repository is named <var>myrepo</var>):</p>

<pre><kbd>cd ~/Dropbox</kbd>

<kbd>mkdir -p repos/myrepo.git</kbd>

<kbd>cd !$</kbd>

<kbd>git --bare init</kbd></pre>

<p>And that’s the repository created. Basically we made a bare repository in the Dropbox directory.</p>

<p>Now we can add the new <code>remote</code> to our existing repository (again, assuming it lives at <var>~/Projects/myrepo</var>).</p>

<pre><kbd>cd ~/Projects/myrepo</kbd>

<kbd>git remote add dropbox file://$HOME/Dropbox/repos/myrepo.git</kbd>

<kbd>git push dropbox master</kbd></pre>

<p>And we’re done. We’ve created the repository, linked a Git remote to it, and pushed the <var>master</var> branch to the repository. This Git repository will now be available on all computers that your Dropbox account is.</p>

<h2>Pulling from the repository</h2>

<p>When you get to a computer that shares this Dropbox account, but hasn’t checked out Git yet, do as follows:</p>

<pre><kbd>cd ~/Projects</kbd>

<kbd>git clone -o dropbox file://$HOME/Dropbox/repos/myrepo.git</kbd></pre>

<p>Which will add your repository locally, and automatically set up a remote called <var>dropbox</var> which auto–merges with <var>master</var>.</p>

<p>I think this approach could be valuable for things like keeping personal documents or text files in version control (or indeed personal coding projects) without bothering to set up your own Linux box or server. Git really does make these things incredibly easy.</p>
