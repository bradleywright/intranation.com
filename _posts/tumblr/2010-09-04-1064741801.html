title: UX professional is a real role, and an important one
---

<p>Over at <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/">ThinkVitamin</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ryancarson">Ryan Carson</a> has boldly declared that <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/opinion/ux-professional-isnt-a-real-job/">‘UX Professional’ isn’t a Real Job</a>. He lists a (relatively small) number of reasons for this, the primary being:</p>



<blockquote cite="http://thinkvitamin.com/opinion/ux-professional-isnt-a-real-job/"><p>A web site or app should be the product of a Web Designer and a Web Developer&#8230;(a)nyone else who is added into this equation is a waste of money and time.</p></blockquote>



<p>This seems a fairly limiting argument on the face of it, as his argument is clearly confined to small (perhaps 2 person, if we take his example literally) teams. He further clarifies his position in the comments:</p>



<blockquote cite="http://thinkvitamin.com/opinion/ux-professional-isnt-a-real-job/#comment-22713"><p>Why would someone hire web designers [who are awesome at making a site look good&#8230;but horrible at making an interface usable]? That’s the point of the post. UX shouldn’t be an optional skill for web designers.</p></blockquote>



<p>which would probably confirm to most people that this article is merely a linkbait article with a controversial title.</p>



<p>Now, I could leave it at that, but <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">someone is wrong on the Internet</a>, so I am compelled by duty to continue.</p>



<p>As someone who has certainly worked with many good user experience designers (<a href="http://yahnyinlondon.com" rel="met sweetheart friend muse">my fiancée</a> being one of them), I feel the need to weigh in with my own opinion. Be warned that this response may be condescending.</p>



<p>Much like the <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/2090">recent flame war over <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr></a> specialists being “snake oil salesmen” etc., I can see how a <a href="http://carsonified.com/team/ryan/">small team, like Ryan’s</a>, would not feel the need to hire in specialists. After all, when you’re building “web apps” (most of us professionals still call them “websites”, since that&#8217;s what they are) with the size and audience Carsonified’s sites usually get, you don&#8217;t really need to specialise, as a small team can, on the surface of things, achieve all that&#8217;s required for a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/03/how-to-build-a-web-app-in-four-days-for-10000-say-hello-to-matt/">four day buildout</a>.</p>



<p>However, this is the same boneheaded planning that leads developers who have installed Rails for a personal blog to believe they won&#8217;t need a sysadmin, or the same developers to believe they won&#8217;t need a backend specialist to actually make their system scale (<a href="http://failwhale.com/">Twitter circa 2008</a> being a fantastic example of the latter). At some point and level of success, you’ll want people who are the best at their individual piece of the puzzle, be it: administering servers; optimising your site for discoverability (a nice way of saying SEO); keeping your <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym> usage low; or designing a complex multi-form flow in a way that doesn&#8217;t haemorrage users through sheer boredom and depression. The latter is just one way a good user experience designer can help (for the others you want people of the beards and sandal variety).</p>



<p>Again, when working on simple sites, like a <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/">conference site</a>, or an <a href="http://carsonified.com/">agency site</a> (basically just structured content), you probably don&#8217;t need to get in a specialist. And whilst most of the UX professionals I know have come from a design background (the &#8220;web designer&#8221; Ryan mentions in his post), and they certainly fit his mould of &#8220;do-it-all designers&#8221;, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s room in a single person&#8217;s head to stay on top of all current research on user experience, much like there&#8217;s not really enough room in my head to understand 7 browsers with their quirks, and also understand how to optimise a message queue for high throughput. This is a simple human limitation, and I&#8217;m okay with that. I&#8217;d rather have a team of 7 specialists doing their piece than 5 generalists doing an 80% job.</p>



<p>Why? Because user experience is simply too important to not take into account, and to not have the best people working on it. Being a methodical, precise person who is happy to dig through reams of research and multi-variate testing doesn&#8217;t necessarily make for a good creative, so I&#8217;m perfectly happy to see them as separate people and roles. Yes, it&#8217;s nice to have people who are superstars at everything, but in real life this just doesn&#8217;t happen. As managers of teams we need to be realistic about this. And utimately that&#8217;s my problem—his idea simply isn&#8217;t realistic (leaving aside the fact that it&#8217;s an incredibly rude post to begin with).</p>



<p>Writing a post like this has simply shown up Ryan to be vastly less experienced in sizable and cutting edge web teams than he pretends, and should be a valuable lesson for any aspirants reading his blog: successful teams are made up of many people, and the bigger the team, the more specialised they need to be.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://kapowaz.net" rel="met friend colleague">Ben Darlow</a> has also <a href="http://stumble.kapowaz.net/post/1063986523/ux-bullshit">written up his opinion of the matter</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="http://tumblr.intranation.com/post/1065121682/follow-up-to-previous-ux-and-ryan-carson-post">Ryan has responded to me on Twitter, and I followed up</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Update 3 (yay, more):</strong> Andy Budd has <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2010/09/why_i_think_rya/index.php">written an excellent rebuttal to Ryan</a> which includes a brief foray into the history of job titles on the web, and how UX fits into that scheme. I agree with pretty much everything he&#8217;s said.</p>
