  Experiments in burger making&lt;br/&gt;
==============================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a recent discussion with `a friend `_, and a lazy summer afternoon in London, I decided (much to `my fianceé&amp;#8217;s `_ disgust) to cook several kinds of burgers in the American style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking my inspiration from `a Hamburger Today `_, I set out to create three distinct burger styles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* A `smash burger `_, which is a super-thin fast food-alike burger;&lt;br/&gt;
* A `slider `_, in the style of famous American burger chain `White Castle &amp;gt;`_; and&lt;br/&gt;
* A standard, slightly thicker burger in the pub style, but with the addition of `Salt and Fat&amp;#8217;s divot `_ to see if I could stop it falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the burgers were made using just fresh mince from my local butcher and some salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Smash&lt;br/&gt;
=========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Smash is a currently popular style due to its likeness to standard fast food burgers, but it&amp;#8217;s typically made with better ingredients. To follow along, try this `full slider recipe `_.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as I was making testing burgers, I used a cast iron skillet (like `this one from Amazon `_), and heated it with a teaspoon of oil unti the oil was smoking. Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Roll mince into a golf-ball sized ball, and give it a very slight pat to firm it up;&lt;br/&gt;
* Season one side with salt;&lt;br/&gt;
* Place the seasoned side down in the skillet, and season the upper side;&lt;br/&gt;
* Let it cook for a minute before flipping; and then&lt;br/&gt;
* Squash down with your spatchula on the browned circle now present.&amp;#187;&amp;#187;&amp;#187;&amp;#187;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>food</tag><tag>cooking</tag></post>
