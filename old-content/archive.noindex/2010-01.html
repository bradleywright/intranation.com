        <h1>How to set up your own private Git server on Linux</h1><div><p><strong>Update 2:</strong> as pointed out by <a href="http://timhuegdon.com/" rel="friend met colleague">Tim Huegdon</a>, several comments on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1652414">a Hacker News thread pointing here</a>, and the excellent <a href="http://progit.org/book/ch4-8.html">Pro Git</a> book, <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/">Gitolite</a> seems to be a better solution for multi-user hosted Git than Gitosis. I particularly like the branch–level permissions aspect, and what that means for business teams. I’ve left the original article intact.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> the ever–vigilant <a href="http://mikewest.org" rel="friend met colleague">Mike West</a> has pointed out that my instructions for <a href="#permissions-change">permissions</a> and <a href="#git-co-change">git checkout</a> were slightly askew. These errors have been rectified.</p>
<p>One of the things I’m attempting to achieve this year is simplifying my life somewhat. Given how much of my life revolves around technology, a large part of this will be consolidating the various services I consume (and often pay for). The mention of payment is important, as up until now I’ve been paying the awesome <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> for their basic plan.</p>
<p>I don’t have many private repositories with them, and all of them are strictly private code (this blog; <a href="http://yahnyinlondon.com" rel="sweetheart met friend co-resident">Amanda’s blog templates and styles</a>; and some other bits) which don&#8217;t require collaborators. For this reason, paying money to GitHub (awesome though they may be) seemed wasteful.</p>
<p>So I decided to move all my private repositories to my own server. This is how I did it.</p>
<h2>Set up the server</h2>
<p>These instructions were performed on a Debian 5 &#8220;Lenny&#8221; box, so assume them to be the same on Ubuntu. Substitute the package installation commands as required if you’re on an alternative distribution.</p>
<p>First, if you haven’t done so already, add your public key to the server:</p>

<pre><kbd>ssh myuser@server.com mkdir .ssh</kbd>
<kbd>scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub myuser@server.com:.ssh/authorized_keys</kbd></pre>

<p>Now we can SSH into our server and install Git:</p>

<pre><kbd>ssh myserver.com</kbd>
<kbd>sudo apt-get update</kbd>
<kbd>sudo apt-get install git-core</kbd></pre>

<p>&#8230;and that’s it.</p>

<h3>Adding a user</h3>

<p>If you intend to share these repositories with any collaborators, at this point you’ll either:</p>
<ul><li>Want to install something like <a href="http://eagain.net/gitweb/?p=gitosis.git">Gitosis</a> (outside the scope of this article, but <a href="http://scie.nti.st/2007/11/14/hosting-git-repositories-the-easy-and-secure-way">this is a good, if old, tutorial</a>); or</li>
<li>Add a “shared” Git user.</li>
</ul><p>We’ll be following the latter option. So, add a Git user:</p>

<pre><kbd>sudo adduser git</kbd></pre>

<p>Now you’ll need to add your public key to the Git user’s <code>authorized_keys</code>:</p>
<pre id="permissions-change"><kbd>sudo mkdir /home/git/.ssh</kbd>
<kbd>sudo cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/git/.ssh/</kbd>
<kbd>sudo chown -R git:git /home/git/.ssh</kbd>
<kbd>sudo chmod 700 !$</kbd>
<kbd>sudo chmod 600 /home/git/.ssh/*</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Now you’ll be able to authenticate as the Git user via SSH. Test it out:</p>
<pre><kbd>ssh git@myserver.com</kbd></pre>

<h2>Add your repositories</h2>
<p>If you were to not share the repositories, and just wanted to access them for yourself (like I did, since I have no collaborators), you’d do the following as yourself. Otherwise, do it as the Git user we added above.</p>
<p>If using the Git user, log in as them:</p>
<pre><kbd>login git</kbd></pre>
<p>Now we can create our repositories:</p>
<pre><kbd>mkdir myrepo.git</kbd>
<kbd>cd !$</kbd>
<kbd>git --bare init</kbd></pre>
<p>The last steps creates an empty repository. We’re assuming you already have a local repository that you just want to push to a remote server.</p>
<p>Repeat that last step for each remote Git repository you want.</p>
<p>Log out of the server as the remaining operations will be completed on your local machine.</p>
<h2>Configure your development machine</h2>
<p>First, we add the remotes to your <em>local machine</em>. If you’ve already defined a remote named <var>origin</var> (for example, if you followed GitHub’s instructions), you’ll want to delete the remote first:</p>
<pre><kbd>git remote rm origin</kbd></pre>
<p>Now we can add our new remote:</p>
<pre><kbd>git remote add origin git@server.com:myrepo.git</kbd>
<kbd>git push origin master</kbd></pre>
<p>And that’s it. You&#8217;ll probably also want to make sure you add a default merge and remote:</p>
<pre><kbd>git config branch.master.remote origin &amp;&amp; git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master</kbd></pre>

<p>And that’s all. Now you can push/pull from <var>origin</var> as much as you like, and it’ll be stored remotely on your own <var>myserver.com</var> remote repository.</p>

<h2>Bonus points: Make SSH more secure</h2>

<p>This has been extensively covered by the <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2009/3/31/debian-lenny-setup-page-1">excellent Slicehost tutorial</a>, but just to recap:</p>

<p>Edit the SSH config:</p>
<pre><kbd>sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config</kbd></pre>
<p>And change the following values:</p>
<pre><code>Port 2207
...
PermitRootLogin no
...
AllowUsers myuser git
...
PasswordAuthentication no</code></pre>
<p>Where <var>2207</var> is a port of your choosing. Make sure to add this so your Git remote:</p>
<pre id="git-co-change"><kbd>git remote add origin ssh://git@myserver.com:2207/~/myrepo.git</kbd></pre></div>
