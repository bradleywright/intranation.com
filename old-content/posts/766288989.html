That’s not to say they’re not worthwhile (I’ve learned loads from &lt;a href="http://marknormanfrancis.com/" rel="friend met colleague"&gt;Norm&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://github.com/norm/homedir/tree"&gt;homedir&lt;/a&gt; project alone), but more that the difficulty and relative cost of establishing new projects has been dramatically reduced by GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that caveat in mind, I still think it’s worth mentioning my latest project: &lt;a href="https://github.com/bradleywright/django-static-management/tree"&gt;Django Static Management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/"&gt;YSlow&lt;/a&gt; was first introduced, an ongoing problem has been “how to manage your files in a YSlow friendly way?”. In &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/"&gt;Answers&lt;/a&gt;, the modern incarnation of which runs on &lt;a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/"&gt;Symfony&lt;/a&gt;, we solved this by using configuration to list the required &lt;abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"&gt;CSS&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="JavaScript"&gt;JS&lt;/abbr&gt; files, and then having a build script run at build time to compile and minify these files. I always found this to be the most elegant way of managing your files, as they’re all stored in a single place, in a format (&lt;abbr title="Yet another Markup Language"&gt;YML&lt;/abbr&gt;) that’s easily understood by even the most configuration–phobic front end developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of storing the names of these files in one central place is twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’re visible to all developers on a project (and not buried somewhere in a template); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’re easily accessible by automated scripts when creating a production version of a site (since YSlow preaches that we should combine our files into a single file to reduce HTTP overhead).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unified Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; itself, as my primary development environment these days, has no defined approach to handling static assets (and indeed the &lt;a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/#howto-static-files"&gt;documentation is quite vague concerning this&lt;/a&gt;), so I figured as a developer in a fairly unique position (being both a Django developer and a fairly experienced front end developer), I would take it upon myself to solve this. For myself and my own preferred style, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface I wanted would provide all the tools required to build and run a website (including the often overlooked development aspect of making sites), and be easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing Django Static Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a bad name, but here’s &lt;a href="http://github.com/bradleywright/django-static-management/tree"&gt;Django Static Management&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment it’s very much a 0.1 release, but it’s robust enough that people can start using it on their development environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the documentation is &lt;a href="http://github.com/bradleywright/django-static-management/tree"&gt;already included in the README&lt;/a&gt;, so I won’t bore you with that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can see the future roadmap in the code itself, but to summarise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hooks for integration with build/compression scripts, like &lt;a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/"&gt;YUI Compressor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html"&gt;JSMin&lt;/a&gt;, or even Norm’s soon to be released (I hope) &lt;a href="http://github.com/norm/p5-css-prepare/tree"&gt;p5-css-prepare&lt;/a&gt;; and&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Support for time-stamping filenames, to provide support for &lt;a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#expires"&gt;far future expires headers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a short list, but then I had a busy day, and to be honest the desired feature list is currently quite short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason this is a post on my site rather than just a GitHub project is that I’d like to draw attention and feature requests to the project over a wider audience than just my GitHub friends. I actually think this project will be relatively useful, but it’ll be more useful if people try and break it and feed back to me.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
