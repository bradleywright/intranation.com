&lt;blockquote cite="http://vmware.com/support/fusion2/doc/releasenotes_fusion_202.html"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supports Ubuntu 8.10 as a guest operating system, including features such as VMware Tools with prebuilt kernel modules, Easy Install, and Unity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and I did find this to be the case, until the first system upgrade hit and I had to reboot. Then I found that I could no longer resize the window and have the desktop adjust resolutions appropriately, and copy/paste no longer worked between desktops. In short, VMWare Tools was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to fix it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re unlucky enough to have this happen to you, I suggest the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optional first step: in your Ubuntu VM, type: &lt;kbd&gt;sudo apt-get install ssh&lt;/kbd&gt; to install SSH. This at least allows you to access the box from your Mac with copy/paste etc. (To find out the IP address, type &lt;kbd&gt;ifconfig&lt;/kbd&gt;, and note the &lt;samp&gt;eth0 &amp;#8230; inet addr:&lt;/samp&gt; value.);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invoke the following command as root (either with &lt;samp&gt;sudo&lt;/samp&gt; or as root itself): &lt;kbd&gt;/usr/bin/vmware-config-tools.pl&lt;/kbd&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer the default answer to each of the questions asked (most of them are &lt;samp&gt;yes&lt;/samp&gt;, except for the experimental question).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart your box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should now have a working VMWare Tools installation that survives over reboots. Makes playing with Linux desktops much more palatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMWare Tools seems like it fails to start after updating the system due to the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;samp&gt;/usr/lib/vmware-tools/sbin32/vmware-guestd: error while loading shared libraries: libdnet.so.1: 
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know enough about Linux to have a guess what that means, but I suppose that when VMWare Tools is re–compiled in the steps mentioned above that it reconciles this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…and why was I trying out Ubuntu?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m currently learning &lt;a href="http://erlang.org/"&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt;, and since the Mac version is a bit crippled and slow it seemed best to use a Linux &lt;abbr title="distribution"&gt;distro&lt;/abbr&gt; to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
