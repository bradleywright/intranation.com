He lists a (relatively small) number of reasons for this, the primary being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite="http://thinkvitamin.com/opinion/ux-professional-isnt-a-real-job/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A web site or app should be the product of a Web Designer and a Web Developer&amp;#8230;(a)nyone else who is added into this equation is a waste of money and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems a fairly limiting argument on the face of it, as his argument is clearly confined to small (perhaps 2 person, if we take his example literally) teams. He further clarifies his position in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite="http://thinkvitamin.com/opinion/ux-professional-isnt-a-real-job/#comment-22713"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would someone hire web designers [who are awesome at making a site look good&amp;#8230;but horrible at making an interface usable]? That’s the point of the post. UX shouldn’t be an optional skill for web designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which would probably confirm to most people that this article is merely a linkbait article with a controversial title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I could leave it at that, but &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/386/"&gt;someone is wrong on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, so I am compelled by duty to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who has certainly worked with many good user experience designers (&lt;a href="http://yahnyinlondon.com" rel="met sweetheart friend muse"&gt;my fiancée&lt;/a&gt; being one of them), I feel the need to weigh in with my own opinion. Be warned that this response may be condescending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the &lt;a href="http://powazek.com/posts/2090"&gt;recent flame war over &lt;abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation"&gt;SEO&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specialists being “snake oil salesmen” etc., I can see how a &lt;a href="http://carsonified.com/team/ryan/"&gt;small team, like Ryan’s&lt;/a&gt;, would not feel the need to hire in specialists. After all, when you’re building “web apps” (most of us professionals still call them “websites”, since that&amp;#8217;s what they are) with the size and audience Carsonified’s sites usually get, you don&amp;#8217;t really need to specialise, as a small team can, on the surface of things, achieve all that&amp;#8217;s required for a &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/03/how-to-build-a-web-app-in-four-days-for-10000-say-hello-to-matt/"&gt;four day buildout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is the same boneheaded planning that leads developers who have installed Rails for a personal blog to believe they won&amp;#8217;t need a sysadmin, or the same developers to believe they won&amp;#8217;t need a backend specialist to actually make their system scale (&lt;a href="http://failwhale.com/"&gt;Twitter circa 2008&lt;/a&gt; being a fantastic example of the latter). At some point and level of success, you’ll want people who are the best at their individual piece of the puzzle, be it: administering servers; optimising your site for discoverability (a nice way of saying SEO); keeping your &lt;acronym title="Random Access Memory"&gt;RAM&lt;/acronym&gt; usage low; or designing a complex multi-form flow in a way that doesn&amp;#8217;t haemorrage users through sheer boredom and depression. The latter is just one way a good user experience designer can help (for the others you want people of the beards and sandal variety).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, when working on simple sites, like a &lt;a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/"&gt;conference site&lt;/a&gt;, or an &lt;a href="http://carsonified.com/"&gt;agency site&lt;/a&gt; (basically just structured content), you probably don&amp;#8217;t need to get in a specialist. And whilst most of the UX professionals I know have come from a design background (the &amp;#8220;web designer&amp;#8221; Ryan mentions in his post), and they certainly fit his mould of &amp;#8220;do-it-all designers&amp;#8221;, I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s room in a single person&amp;#8217;s head to stay on top of all current research on user experience, much like there&amp;#8217;s not really enough room in my head to understand 7 browsers with their quirks, and also understand how to optimise a message queue for high throughput. This is a simple human limitation, and I&amp;#8217;m okay with that. I&amp;#8217;d rather have a team of 7 specialists doing their piece than 5 generalists doing an 80% job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because user experience is simply too important to not take into account, and to not have the best people working on it. Being a methodical, precise person who is happy to dig through reams of research and multi-variate testing doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily make for a good creative, so I&amp;#8217;m perfectly happy to see them as separate people and roles. Yes, it&amp;#8217;s nice to have people who are superstars at everything, but in real life this just doesn&amp;#8217;t happen. As managers of teams we need to be realistic about this. And utimately that&amp;#8217;s my problem—his idea simply isn&amp;#8217;t realistic (leaving aside the fact that it&amp;#8217;s an incredibly rude post to begin with).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a post like this has simply shown up Ryan to be vastly less experienced in sizable and cutting edge web teams than he pretends, and should be a valuable lesson for any aspirants reading his blog: successful teams are made up of many people, and the bigger the team, the more specialised they need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://kapowaz.net" rel="met friend colleague"&gt;Ben Darlow&lt;/a&gt; has also &lt;a href="http://stumble.kapowaz.net/post/1063986523/ux-bullshit"&gt;written up his opinion of the matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://tumblr.intranation.com/post/1065121682/follow-up-to-previous-ux-and-ryan-carson-post"&gt;Ryan has responded to me on Twitter, and I followed up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3 (yay, more):&lt;/strong&gt; Andy Budd has &lt;a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2010/09/why_i_think_rya/index.php"&gt;written an excellent rebuttal to Ryan&lt;/a&gt; which includes a brief foray into the history of job titles on the web, and how UX fits into that scheme.
