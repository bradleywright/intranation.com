His article covers all same details as mine, but with specific regard to VirtualBox, so I suggest you read that if you’re after VirtualBox information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I had some issues with VirtualBox that I thought were worth outlining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;VirtualBox file sharing &lt;a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/818"&gt;doesn’t support symbolic or hard links&lt;/a&gt;, which also means that my &lt;a href="http://intranation.com/entries/2009/12/python-virtualenv-quickstart-django/"&gt;much–used &lt;var&gt;virtualenv&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t work correctly. This is a deal breaker for me, basically;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking from host to guest can be a pain, as evidenced by &lt;a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2010/02/08/howto-ssh-into-virtualbox-3-linux-guests/"&gt;Stuart Colville’s post regarding host–only network adapters&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhat subjectively, I don’t much like VirtualBox from an interface perspective, and as VMWare seems like a pretty smart company (see their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.vmware.com/console/2010/03/vmware-hires-key-developer-for-redis.html"&gt;recent Redis talent acquisition as proof&lt;/a&gt;) I’m happy to continue supporting them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I discovered Benjamin’s post through my own ego–tastic &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/alerts"&gt;Google Alerts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
