&lt;p&gt;However, my general policy is that I&amp;#8217;m always happy to pay a small fee to services I don&amp;#8217;t use in a way I should to justify their value, but merely to reward them for doing good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that brings me to the point of my post: with &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s new &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/817-behold-image-view-modes"&gt;image view modes&lt;/a&gt;, they&amp;#8217;re doing amazing things for version control and collaboration, and I wanted to support that. So I&amp;#8217;m now a paid up member of GitHub again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep up the good work!&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>github</tag><tag>software</tag></post>
