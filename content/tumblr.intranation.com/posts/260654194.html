This I do slightly begrudgingly, but do so for the following reasons:&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The effort of setting up my own WebDAV server in order to keep my precious &lt;a href="http://omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; running across my phone and desktop is too much at the moment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like having push calendar updates; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like having push address book updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;My chief problem with MobileMe is that it just seems to be implemented badly, which, as a professional developer, grates on me. It’s very slow over WebDAV (taking around 10s to sync a small SQLite database), and the way files are shared over iDisk is just stupid: it creates a pre–sized disk image (in my case 2GB) on your hard drive and then syncs that. What if I had chosen to use the maximum 20GB size? I&amp;#8217;d have a 20GB lump (mostly empty) sitting on my hard drive, because the size is pre–allocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dropbox.com"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; is a shining example of how to do file–sharing between computers properly: it creates a folder in your home directory that just takes up the room required by the files you’ve uploaded. Easy, works seamlessly, and has a sweet iPhone application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, MobileMe is seeming like more of a hassle than is worth the money: and it’s &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/pricing/"&gt;quite a bit of money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>apple</tag><tag>internet</tag><tag>mobileme</tag><tag>rant</tag></post>
