        <p><img src="../images/840001962.jpg"/></p><p>The hard as nails Jens Voigt talking about his crash yesterday, via <a href="http://www.bigringriding.com/post/837968905/loaner" class="tumblr_blog">bigringriding</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>JENS WRITING ON <a href="http://www.bicycling.com/tour-de-france/tour-features/saying-no-sag-wagon">BICYCLING.COM</a> FROM HIS HOSPITAL BED. WHAT AN AWESOME GUY.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That stage pretty much got off on the wrong foot. For starters, we just went out so hard. We started out climbing up the Peyresourde Pass and everybody came out with their guns smoking.</p>
<p>I came over the top only 20 seconds down on the front group, but about 2 kilometers into the descent my front tire blew and I thought, “Oh God,” and I went down. Just one year after my horrible crash, and there I was tumbling on another mountain descent. And let me tell you, about the only place that feels good right now is my right ankle. The rest of me is all road rash. Plus I’ve got five stitches in my left elbow and then there are some ribs that are not in the right place! I may have to get x-rays, but I hate x-rays (the radiation), and plus, if I’ve got a fractured rib, what can anyone do about it?</p>
<p>The worst thing of all was that I almost got forced out of the Tour for a second year in a row. The problem was that the first team car was behind Andy Schleck, and the second had decided to go up ahead to hand out water bottles at the foot of the next climb. As a result I had no bike, because mine was shattered.</p>
<p>So then the broom wagon pulled up and was like, “Do you want to just get in?” And I said, “Oh no, I don’t need YOU!” But there I am with blood spurting out my left elbow and no bike. Finally, the race organizers got me a bike, but it was this little yellow junior bike. It was way too small for me and even had old-fashioned toe-clip pedals. But that is the only way I could get down the mountain, so I had to ride it for like 15-20 kilometers until I finally got to a team car with my bike.</p>
<p>Then, I still had to get up to the grupetto. All I can say is that that desperate times need desperate measures, but I got up there. And once I did it was grupetto all day long.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I had plenty of time to come up with a fitting book of the day. It’s from the Disk World series by Terry Pratchett. In it, the protagonist is Conan the Barbarian, who is a 70-year-old who has just survived everything. At one point he, and his other old warrior friends capture this village, but then they find that they are surrounded by an army of tens of thousands, and his only reaction is, “Oh man, it’s going to take days to kill all these people!” And that’s the way I was today when I was lying on the ground. I just thought, “Oh no, I’m going to Paris this year, I’m going to Paris. There’s just no way you are going to get me out of this race for the second year in a row!”</p>

        <h1>Web&ndash;based services I pay for</h1><div><p>Inspired by <a href="http://joshr.posterous.com/web-based-services-i-pay-for">Josh’s post</a>, I’ve decided to list (and give a shout out to) the services on the web that I pay for.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://me.com">MobileMe</a> (£59/year) for computer, address book, and calendar synchronisation. I pay for MobileMe because I have 2 Macs (work, home) and an iPhone, and it’s by far the easiest way to keep them all synchronised. It’s a shame it costs so much, as I don’t use the email or website publishing aspects of it at all.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tuffmail.com/">Tuffmail</a> (about £5/month) for <acronym title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</acronym> email. I was put onto Tuffmail by <a href="http://allinthehead.com/" rel="colleague met">Drew</a>. It’s a great service with fantastic spam protection, and since it’s a well–behaved IMAP service it functions much better with desktop <abbr title="applications">apps</abbr> than <a href="http://mail.google.com">Gmail</a>. I’m currently on the fence as to whether I’m going to go back to <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps for your domain</a> for email and calendar. For the moment Tuffmail is great, though.</li>
<li><a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">PRGMR</a> ($48/year) for <abbr title="Virtual private server">VPS</abbr> hosting. I moved away from <a href="http://slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> a few months back because I wanted to downscale my hosting costs. PRGMR have been great so far, really solid, and the price is certainly right.</li>
<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (about £0.03/month) for S3 and CloudFront. I host static assets and some other backup type things there. It’s clearly the cheapest thing on my expenses list.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> ($25/year) for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/intranation">photo hosting</a>. I’m sure everyone knows what Flickr is by now.</li>
<li><a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> ($36/year). I like Last.fm and what they do, as well as using their service a lot, so I think it’s worth paying for.</li>
</ul><h2>Things I used to pay for</h2>
<ul><li><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>. I stopped this because I now <a href="http://tumblr.intranation.com/post/766290565/how-set-up-your-own-private-git-server-linux">host my own private Git <abbr title="repositories">repos</abbr></a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> for VPS hosting. See above.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, I’d like to mention <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>. As a service I think Dropbox is absolutely best of breed—it’s hands down the smoothest, slickest, and most tightly integrated web/desktop hybrid I’ve ever used. I don’t actually pay for it as I don’t have a requirement for their lowest plan yet, but if I did I’d pay it without thinking. Fantastic service (I have a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE5NjgwOQ">referral link, too</a>), cannot recommend it highly enough. I wish MobileMe was as slick as Dropbox.</p></div>

        <div class="quote">&ldquo;Here’s what worries me about the paywall. When we talk about newspapers, we talk about them being critical for informing the public; we never say they’re critical for informing their customers. We assume that the value of the news ramifies outwards from the readership to society as a whole. OK, I buy that. But what Murdoch is signing up to do is to prevent that value from escaping. He wants to only inform his customers, he doesn’t want his stories to be shared and circulated widely. In fact, his ability to charge for the paywall is going to come down to his ability to lock the public out of the conversation convened by the Times.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jul/05/clay-shirky-internet-television-newspapers">Clay Shirky</a> (via <a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org/" class="tumblr_blog">czottmann</a>)</div>

        <h1>Moved to Tumblr</h1><div><p>So I’ve moved my <a href="http://intranation.com">old <abbr title="weblog">blog</abbr></a> over to <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>’s excellent free service.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>One of the main reasons is that I hadn’t updated my other site since March, and before that I’d posted a mere 12 times.</p>
<p>I felt weighed down by the usual length of my posts, and whilst this was likely an issue and expectation only I had, it was demotivating.</p>
<p>Of course, the length issue could be solved by just posting shorting missives to my site, but the custom software I’d written wasn’t very supportive of that kind of post, and given my fairly busy <a href="http://smarkets.com/">day job at Smarkets</a> I was unwilling to spend any time adding features. Tumblr, on the other hand, is perfect for multi–medium and multi–form posts.</p>
<p>I also had existing experience skinning <a href="http://yahnyinlondon.com/" rel="friend met sweetheart">Amanda</a>’s own Tumblr, so I know I can customise it fairly easily.</p>
<h2>The move</h2>
<p>So with that out of the way, here we are. I hope to post more, but in lesser form, in the future.</p></div>
