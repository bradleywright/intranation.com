About Bradley Wright
====================

Bradley Wright
--------------

Bradley Wright (Brad to most people), is a professional web developer living
and working in London, United Kingdom.

Currently he works as Director of Web Development at `Smarkets`__, a
London-based online betting exchange. The Director bit doesn’t mean much right
now, since we’re a tiny startup—but don’t let that put you off being impressed!

When asked to describe himself for a conference, he used the following
paragraph:

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote><p>
    Bradley Wright, never one for stereotypes, is an Australian living in
    London. Having graduated from the shady realms of speed-dating web sites,
    he now works for Yahoo! as a web developer on Yahoo! Answers. Brad enjoys
    electronic music, reading, beer, and being photographed with beer.
    </p></blockquote>

…which he thinks is a pretty neat summary. Except now he’d add cycling to his
interests. And obviously I don’t work at Yahoo! any more.

Brad can also be found on `GitHub`__, `Twitter`__, `Flickr`__, and `Last.FM`__,
mostly under the handle “intranation”. He guarantees this is the
only page where the third (grammatical) person will be used.

This site
---------

This is the third iteration of my personal blog. The first was a hand-rolled
`Django`__ application that become a maintenance pain. The second was a
`Tumblr`__ blog that I never quite became attached to. This version is based on
`Armin Ronacher's`__  `rstblog`__ code. Of course it's `open-source`__.

The site itself just compiles to HTML5 and CSS. There's the minimum amount of
Javascript required to inject Google Analytics. That's it really.
