# Bradley Wright

Bradley Wright (Brad to most people), is a professional web developer living
and working in London, United Kingdom.

## This site

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which means it
just compiles to HTML5 and CSS. There's the minimum amount of
Javascript required to inject Google Analytics. That's it really.

I've made [the source code available](https://github.com/bradleywright/intranation.com) if you're interested.

## Contacting me

I’ve been told I’m very hard to get in touch with, so here’s how to reach me
via email: `brad [at] this domain`.
